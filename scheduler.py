"""
scheduler.py — Automated trading cycle runner for Railway deployment.

This is the process entrypoint for production. It drives the entire trading
loop according to the RUN_MODE set in .env:

    fixed_6x:        6 scheduled cycles per day at fixed market times.
    intraday_30min:  Every 30 minutes from 9:30 AM to 3:30 PM.

Both modes share the same 3:45 PM pre-close run (intraday position flush)
and 4:00 PM end-of-day report generation.

The CircuitBreaker is instantiated at module level so its high-water mark
state persists across all cycles within the same process lifetime without
requiring repeated disk reads.

Run locally:
    python scheduler.py

Deploy on Railway:
    Set the start command to: python scheduler.py
