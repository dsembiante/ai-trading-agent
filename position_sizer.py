"""
position_sizer.py — Calculates position size, stop-loss, take-profit, and
                    max hold duration for each trade based on hold period tier.

Sizing logic follows a risk-first approach:
    1. Start from the maximum allowed risk in USD (portfolio * max_position_pct)
    2. Scale down toward 50% of that budget for lower-confidence trades
    3. Apply a hold period scalar — longer-conviction trades get slightly more size
    4. Hard-cap at 130% of the base risk budget (2.6% of portfolio maximum)

Stop-loss and take-profit percentages are sourced from config so they can be
tuned without touching this file.

Usage:
    from position_sizer import PositionSizer
    sizer = PositionSizer()
    sizing = sizer.calculate(portfolio_value, current_price, confidence, hold_period)

        Compute the dollar position size and share count for a trade.

        Confidence scaling:
            Confidence below 0.75 is blocked upstream by the risk manager, so
            the scalar maps the range [0.75, 1.0] → [0.0, 1.0]. A confidence
            of 0.75 produces 50% of the max budget; 1.0 produces 100%.

        Hold period scaling:
            Intraday trades receive 70% of the base size — smaller exposure for
            same-day exits where the thesis has less time to play out.
            Swing is the baseline at 100%.
            Position trades receive 130% — higher conviction, longer runway.
