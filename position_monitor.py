"""
position_monitor.py — Enforces hold period rules and intraday exit discipline.

Runs on every scheduler cycle to audit all open positions against their
time-based exit constraints. Two exit mechanisms are managed here:

1. Hold Period Expiry — any position that has been held longer than its
   max_hold_days budget (set at entry time by position_sizer.py) is closed
   regardless of P&L. This prevents trades from drifting outside their
   intended risk window.

2. Intraday Forced Close — all positions classified as 'intraday' are closed
   before market close (3:45 PM cycle) to eliminate overnight gap risk.

Note: Stop-loss and take-profit exits are handled by Alpaca bracket orders
placed at entry time via trade_executor.py — not by this module.

Usage:
    from position_monitor import PositionMonitor
    monitor = PositionMonitor(trade_executor=executor)
    monitor.check_all_positions()
