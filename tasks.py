"""
tasks.py — CrewAI task definitions for the AI trading crew.

Each task wraps a natural-language prompt with a strict JSON output schema
(via output_json) so the LLM is forced to return structured, Pydantic-
validatable data rather than free-form text.

Task execution order per ticker:
    1. Bull Task     — independent, analyses long opportunity
    2. Bear Task     — independent, analyses downside/short opportunity
    3. Risk Task     — depends on (1) and (2); synthesises final decision
    4. Portfolio Task — depends on (3); validates against portfolio constraints

Tasks 1 and 2 can run in parallel; 3 and 4 are sequential gates.

The hold period guidance embedded in each prompt is intentionally repeated
across tasks — each agent must independently classify the timeframe so the
risk manager can evaluate consistency between bull and bear views.

# ── Analyst Tasks ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

def create_bull_task(agent, ticker: str, market_data_summary: str) -> Task:
    """
    Task for the Bull Analyst agent to evaluate a long opportunity.

    The prompt embeds the full market data summary so the LLM has all signals
    in context without requiring tool calls. output_json=AgentAnalysis forces
    the response through Pydantic validation — any missing or malformed field
    raises a validation error that CrewAI will retry before returning.

    Hold period guidance is included in the prompt to ensure the bull agent
    classifies timeframe based on signal strength, not just direction.

    Args:
        agent:               The bull CrewAI agent instance from agents.py.
        ticker:              Symbol being analysed.
        market_data_summary: Pre-formatted string from crew.py containing
                             price, technicals, sentiment, and macro context.

    Returns:
        A configured Task ready to be added to the Crew.

            - hold_period_reasoning: why you chose this hold period

            For hold period guidance:
            - intraday:  strong short-term momentum, news catalyst, tight setup
            - swing:     solid multi-day technical setup, moderate conviction
            - position:  strong fundamental thesis, high conviction, longer timeframe

            Volume guidance: volume_vs_avg above 1.20 is a confirming signal for your bull thesis. volume_vs_avg below 0.80 is a warning — low participation weakens the setup.

# ── Decision Tasks ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

def create_risk_manager_task(agent, ticker: str, bull_task: Task, bear_task: Task) -> Task:
    """
    Task for the Risk Manager agent to synthesise bull and bear analyses
    into a single actionable TradeDecision.

    context=[bull_task, bear_task] causes CrewAI to pass the outputs of both
    analyst tasks into this task's context window automatically, so the risk
    manager sees both JSON responses without any manual wiring.

    The prompt explicitly instructs the agent to leave position_size_usd,
    stop_loss_price, and take_profit_price as null — those are computed by
    position_sizer.py after the decision is returned, using the entry_price
    and hold_period chosen here.

    The confidence threshold is interpolated from config so the prompt always
    reflects the live setting without hardcoding 0.75 in the task string.

    Args:
        agent:     The risk manager CrewAI agent instance.
        ticker:    Symbol being evaluated.
        bull_task: Completed bull analyst task (passed as context).

def create_portfolio_task(agent, ticker: str, risk_task: Task, open_positions: list) -> Task:

    Final portfolio-level gate before a trade decision reaches the executor.

    This task acts as a circuit-breaker for portfolio concentration:

        3. Sector concentration — flags over-exposure to a single sector

    The agent is instructed to pass the TradeDecision through unchanged if
    all checks pass, or flip execute=false with an explanation in
    risk_manager_reasoning if any check fails. Using the same output schema
