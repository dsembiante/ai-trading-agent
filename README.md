# AI Trading Agent

An autonomous, multi-agent trading system built with CrewAI, Groq LLM, and Alpaca Markets. Four specialised AI agents collaborate on every analysis cycle to produce structured, risk-gated trade decisions across intraday, swing, and position holding periods.

### Agent Collaboration Model

Each ticker analysis runs a sequential 4-agent crew:

| Agent | Role | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **Bull Analyst** | Identifies long opportunities, classifies hold period | `AgentAnalysis` |
| **Bear Analyst** | Surfaces downside risks and short setups | `AgentAnalysis` |
| **Risk Manager** | Arbitrates bull/bear debate, sets final hold period, gates at ≥0.75 confidence | `TradeDecision` |
| **Portfolio Manager** | Validates against max positions, duplicate detection, sector concentration | `TradeDecision` |

---

## Hold Period System

The system classifies every trade into one of three holding tiers at the point of decision. Each tier has independent risk parameters enforced by `position_sizer.py` and `position_monitor.py`:

| Tier | Max Hold | Stop Loss | Take Profit | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Intraday** | 1 day | 2% | 4% | News catalysts, strong short-term momentum |
| **Swing** | 5 days | 5% | 10% | Multi-day technical setups, moderate conviction |
| **Position** | 20 days | 8% | 20% | High-conviction fundamental plays |

All three tiers maintain a **2:1 reward-to-risk ratio** by design.

---

## Data Sources

| Source | Data | Tier Required |
|---|---|---|
| **Alpaca** | OHLCV bars, account state, order placement | Free |
| **Finnhub** | News headlines | Free |
| **Finnhub** | Sentiment score | Paid |
| **Alpha Vantage** | Company fundamentals (cached daily) | Free (25 req/day) |
| **FRED** | Fed Funds Rate, CPI inflation (cached daily) | Free |
| **Groq** | LLM inference (llama-3.3-70b-versatile) | Free tier available |

Data collection is designed for graceful degradation — each source is wrapped in an independent try/except. The `DataSourceStatus` model tracks source availability and is stored with every trade record for post-analysis.

---

## Default Watchlist

The system analyses 13 symbols on every cycle, covering three market segments:

| Segment | Tickers |
|---|---|
| **Technology** | AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA |
| **Financials** | JPM, BAC, GS, MS, V |
| **ETFs / Market Proxies** | SPY, QQQ, IWM |

The watchlist is configurable via the `WATCHLIST` field in `config.py`. ETFs provide broad market context that informs the macro framing of individual stock decisions.

---

## Risk Controls

Three independent layers of risk management operate in the system:

**1. Confidence Threshold (Agent Layer)**
The Risk Manager agent only approves trades with a confidence score ≥ 0.75. This is enforced at both the agent prompt level and as a Pydantic field validator on `TradeDecision`.

**2. Position Sizing (Trade Layer)**
Maximum 2% of portfolio per position. Size scales with confidence (0.75→50% of budget, 1.0→100%) and hold period tier (intraday: 0.7×, swing: 1.0×, position: 1.3×). Hard-capped at 2.6% regardless of inputs.

**3. Circuit Breaker (Portfolio Layer)**
Monitors rolling drawdown from the portfolio's all-time peak. At ≥10% drawdown, all trading halts immediately and the event is logged, emailed, and flagged in the dashboard. **No auto-liquidation** — resumption requires manual review and deletion of `data/peak_value.json`.

### `intraday_30min`
Analysis cycle every 30 minutes from 9:30 AM to 3:30 PM, plus the standard 3:45 PM and 4:00 PM jobs.

---

## Dashboard

Run `streamlit run app.py` to access the 8-tab dashboard:

| Tab | Contents |
|---|---|
| **Overview** | Total P&L, win rate, trade count, profit factor |
| **Performance vs S&P 500** | Portfolio equity curve |
| **Active Positions** | Open trades with entry, stop, and target prices |
| **Trade History** | Filterable full log with agent reasoning drill-down |
| **Hold Period Analysis** | P&L breakdown by intraday / swing / position tier |
| **Risk Monitor** | Circuit breaker status, risk parameter summary |
| **Reports** | On-demand PDF generation and download |
| **Settings** | Read-only view of active configuration |

---

## Deployment (Railway)

1. Push repository to GitHub
2. Create a new Railway project from the GitHub repo
3. Set all `.env` variables as Railway environment variables
4. Set the start command to: `python scheduler.py`
5. Set `TZ=America/New_York` in Railway environment variables to ensure market hours are evaluated correctly

---

## Pre-Live Checklist

Before switching `TRADING_MODE=live`, verify all of the following:

- [ ] Backtest win rate ≥ 50% and Sharpe ratio ≥ 0.5 (`python backtester.py`)
- [ ] Minimum 6 months of paper trading with consistent results
- [ ] Circuit breaker has been tested and confirmed functional
- [ ] Email alerts are configured and tested
- [ ] All 4 data sources returning valid data
- [ ] Dashboard displaying accurate open positions and P&L
- [ ] `ALPACA_BASE_URL` updated to `https://api.alpaca.markets`

---

## Backtesting

Before deploying to paper trading, run the built-in backtester to validate the strategy has directional edge on your watchlist:

```bash
python backtester.py
```

The backtester uses a simplified RSI mean-reversion strategy as a proxy (not the full LLM crew, which cannot be replayed historically). It fetches 180 days of Alpaca OHLCV data and simulates entries on RSI < 30 with price above SMA-50, exiting on stop-loss (-5%), take-profit (+10%), or RSI > 70.

**Acceptance thresholds:**
- Win rate ≥ 50%
- Sharpe ratio ≥ 0.5 (annualised)

Results below these thresholds suggest the underlying technicals lack sufficient edge on the current watchlist before the LLM layer is applied.

---

## Reporting

Three PDF report types are generated automatically and available for download from the dashboard:

| Report | Schedule | Location |
|---|---|---|
| **Daily** | Generated at 4:00 PM by the scheduler | `reports/daily/daily_YYYY-MM-DD.pdf` |
| **Weekly** | On-demand or schedulable | `reports/weekly/weekly_YYYY-W##.pdf` |
| **Monthly** | On-demand or schedulable | `reports/monthly/monthly_YYYY-MM.pdf` |

Each report contains: total P&L, win rate, open position count, P&L breakdown by hold period tier, and a trade table for the period.

---

## Logging

Three independent logging surfaces provide full observability:

| File | Contents | Used By |
|---|---|---|
| `logs/errors.log` | Timestamped error entries from all components | Dashboard Risk tab, alerts |
| `logs/run_logs/run_*.json` | Full cycle summary per scheduler run (tickers, trades, duration, API status) | Post-run diagnostics |
| `logs/trade_journal.json` | Append-only JSON array of every trade event | Human-readable audit trail outside SQLite |

---

## Email Alerts

Configure `ALERT_EMAIL` and `ALERT_EMAIL_PASSWORD` in `.env` to receive alerts for:

| Event | Trigger |
|---|---|
| **Circuit Breaker** | Portfolio drawdown reaches 10% — immediate alert, trading halted |
| **Trade Placed** | Every successful order submission |
| **Daily Summary** | End-of-day P&L and trade count at 4:00 PM |
| **API Failure** | Any data source becomes unreachable during collection |

Gmail App Passwords are required (not your regular Gmail password). Generate one at [myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).

---

## Key Design Decisions

**Why SQLite?**
No external infrastructure required. The system is designed to run on a single Railway dyno or local machine. SQLite serialises writes internally, making it safe for the Streamlit and scheduler threads to share a connection with `check_same_thread=False`.

**Why Groq over OpenAI?**
Groq provides significantly lower inference latency on llama-3.3-70b-versatile at a fraction of the cost. Fast inference is important for intraday mode where 13 tickers must be analysed within a 30-minute window.

**Why bracket orders?**
Stop-loss and take-profit legs are submitted atomically with the entry order via Alpaca's bracket order type. This eliminates the race condition where a fill occurs before protective orders are placed.

**Why no auto-liquidation on circuit breaker?**
Forced liquidation during a drawdown event can lock in losses that would otherwise recover. The circuit breaker halts new entries and alerts the operator — position management during a drawdown event is a human decision.
